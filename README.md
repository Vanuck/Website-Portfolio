## Description

Welcome to my personal portfolio page! Here you'll find information about myself, my past projects, and how to get in touch with me.

A responsive onepager to showcase my professional portfolio, designed following a mobile-first approach.
It is built with pure HTML, CSS and some snippets of Javascript to toggle the hamburger menu on mobile screens and for the functionallity of Read more / Read less buttons.
The CSS code uses native variables for repetitive values.
A postprocessor was used to improve browser support.
