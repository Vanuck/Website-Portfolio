        Case Study for
        <span class="movieapp-style">The Pokedex App</span> JavaScript project
      </h1>
      <div class="intro">
        <div class="intro-content">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="movieapp-style">The Pokedex App</span> is a web app,
            developed with JavaScript, that provides users with access to a
            database of Pokemons. Users are able to search specific Pokemons,
            scroll through the graphic list, and select a Pokemon to view
            specifics on that creature.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Purpose &amp; Context</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="movieapp-style">The Pokedex App</span> was a personal
            project I built as part of my web development course at
            CareerFoundry to demonstrate my mastery of JavaScript development.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            To design and build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the
            viewing of data points in detail.The problem I was aiming to solve
            was to be able to build a JavaScript application from scratch.

            <h2>The 5 Ws:</h2>
            <p>
              1. Who—My professional network, as well as potential employers. 2.
              What—A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which
              uses an external API. 3. When—Immediately! The code for the app
              can be viewed in a repository like GitHub or GitLab. 4.
              Where—Potential employers, clients, and collaborators can look at
              the code directly from the GitHub repository or be directed to the
              GitHub profile from my portfolio site. A link to the working app
              will also be available on GitHub. 5. Why—For potential employers,
              clients, and collaborators to see how I created the architecture
              of a JavaScript app, as well as how I tested and debugged the
              code.

            <h4>What I learned</h4>
            <p>
              Since the main goal of this project was to learn programming while
              programming it was especially important to adhere to good coding
              practices and maintain a neat, clean codebase. The code has been
              formatted according to ESLint rules.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>

            <h4>User Goals</h4>
            <p>
              Users should be able to view a list of data and see more details
              for a given data item on demand. For this project a small Pokedex
              app was chosen as the theme.

            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <p>
              ● Load data from an external source (API) ● View a list of items ●
              On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details
              for that item

          <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            ● The app must load data from an external API; in this instance, the
            Pokémon API . ● The app must display a list of items loaded from
            that API after the page is loaded. ● The app must enable the viewing
            of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on demand,
            such as when clicking on a list item. ● The app must have CSS
            styling. ● The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint
            rules. ○ The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier. ○ The
            JavaScript code may be manually formatted. ● The app must use at
            least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for
            details or touch interactions. ○ The app may allow searching for
            items (e.g., searching for Pokémon). ● The app must not throw any
            errors when being used. ● The app should be deployed to a publicly
            accessible platform like GitHub Pages. ● The app must work in
            Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            This was my favorite project since it was my first project that
            allowed more creativity. I have enjoyed building the app and working
            with JavaScript. It took me a while to understand how CSS works
            along with DOM interaction and how to achieve my results. But with
            persistence I was able to achieve my desired results.
